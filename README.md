# wordsapi-backend
Backend (web app) for https://github.com/sadirbaev/wordsapi in "golang".

I have used golang. I have tried to follow Uncle Bob's clean architecture. I used [**echo** web framework](https://github.com/labstack/echo) for the rest API and for connecting to Elastic search I used [olivere's library](https://github.com/olivere/elastic).
And also, I have used other third party libraries.
